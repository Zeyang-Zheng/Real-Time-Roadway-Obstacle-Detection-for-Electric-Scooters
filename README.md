# Real-Time Roadway Obstacle Detection for Electric Scooters Using Deep Learning and Multi-Sensor Fusion

The system uses the YOLOv5s model to detect ground obstacles. It combines RGB and depth images captured by the Intel RealSense Camera D435i to estimate the distance to ground obstacles in real time.
